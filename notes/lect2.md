## Linear Programming (02/2)
- Objective function (z(x)): to be maximized
- Defined by linear constraints
- Intersection of halfplanes (constraints) are called verteces
- A linear program can be:
	- infeasible: region P is empty
	- unbounded: no finite solution exists
	- feasible: solution x inside P
- For a bounded feasible linear program: at least one vertex is an optimal solution

## Simplex Algorithm (02/3)
- Introduce slack variables to get rid of inequalities
	- basic variables for constraints
	- non-basic are those in objective function
- Select a non-basic variable, increase as much as we can

## Integer Programming (02/5)
- Similar to linear, with the condition that all variables be integers
-
